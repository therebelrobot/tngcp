# tngcp-boilerplate

_Note: I'm updating this to more modern versions in the nex few days/weeks, so stay tuned_

Typescript + Next.js + GraphQL + Chakra UI + Prettier boilerplate. Also has Jest, but cramming another letter in there seems excessive.

`yarn lint` is still failing, but everything else is functional.
