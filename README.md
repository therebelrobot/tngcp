TNGCP is a production-ready application template that allows fullstack engineers to quickly bootstrap a new application with sane and secure defaults.

I mainly made this because I kept remaking it over and over, and wanted an easy way to copypasta that for future projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Node (v16, ideally using NVM)
- You have a Mac or Linux machine. Windows might work, but I haven't tested it there.

## Starting out with TNGCP

### Copy the codebase

#### The fast way(s)

- Github Templates: Click the green "Use This Template" button on the main page of the repo, set the name of your new repo, and there you go
- [to come] `tngcp` cli: run the TNGCP cli tool. This is a work in progress, and more docs will be available in the future.

#### The slow way(s)

- Git clone this repo, change the remote url to your git repo, push the changes
- Download a zip file of this repo, place wherever you manage your websites

### Install dependencies

```sh
nvm install && nvm use # this will read .nvmrc to install/switch to Node 16
yarn install # node module dependencies
cp .env.example .env # ensure environment variables are set properly for development
```

### Run application

```sh
yarn start
# start reads the ENVIRONMENT env variable (from .env) to start production or development servers
```

and go to [localhost:9797](http://localhost:9797/) to see it started. A GraphQL playground is running on [localhost:9797/api/graphql](http://localhost:9797/api/graphql)
